### Understanding the data



`GDP per capita` GDP per capita is a measure of a country‚Äôs economic output that accounts for its number of people.

`Social support` Social support means having friends and other people, including family, to turn to in times of need or crisis to give you a broader focus and positive self-image. Social support enhances quality of life and provides a buffer against adverse life events.

`Healthy life expectancy` Healthy Life Expectancy is the average number of years that a newborn can expect to live, not hampered by disabling illnesses or injuries.

`Freedom to make life choices` Freedom of choice describes an individual‚Äôs opportunity and autonomy to perform an action selected from at least two available options, unconstrained by external parties.

`Generosity` The quality of being kind and generous.

`Perceptions of corruption` The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is an index published annually by Transparency International since 1995 which ranks countries ‚Äúby their perceived levels of public sector corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys.
